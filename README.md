# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder
Encode/Decode messages using a Caesar cipher by downloading the HTML file.

Launching the HTML file will open a page in your browser with the following elements:
- Two buttons to toggle between encode and decode mode
- A text box to input the message to be encrypted/decrypted
- Another text box that automatically displays the encrypted/decrypted message
- A number input box to set the size of the Caesar cipher shift
- A Caesar cipher wheel that automatically spins as you change the size of the shift
